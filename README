Biblio::Vger provides access to the backend data of a Voyager ILS -- bib
records, MFHDs, etc.

To build it, you can probably do this:

    PERL=/m1/shared/bin/perl
    $PERL Build.PL
    $PERL Build

Installation depends on how comfortable you are as root on a Voyager production box.  The safest approach is just to copy the whole thing into a directory within the voyager user's home directory, e.g.:

    [log in as voyager, or log in as root and become voyager]
    $ mkdir -p ~/lib/perl5lib
    $ cp -a lib ~/lib/perl5lib

Then add this line to any scripts that rely on these modules:

    use lib "$ENV{HOME}/lib/perl5lib";
